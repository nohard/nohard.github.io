This project is an example of using PyTorch for stock quantitative analysis. It includes the following features:

**1. Data acquisition:** Obtain historical stock data with 5-minute granularity from www.alphavantage.co.

**2. Data preprocessing:** Construct technical indicator data from the raw stock data, including RSI, moving averages, KDJ, MACD, momentum indicators, volatility indicators, etc., and convert it to a format suitable for neural network models.

**3. Model training:** Train reinforcement learning-based neural network models using PyTorch.

**4. Prediction and backtesting:** Use the trained models for stock trading decision-making and backtesting.
<br>(There is still much work to be accomplished.)
 
**It's quite intriguing that 80% of the code was generated by ChatGPT. 
<br>Stupid humans + foolish robots = a bright future!!!**
